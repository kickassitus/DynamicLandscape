# DynamicLandscapeMaterial
DynamicLandscapeMaterial (DLM) is a project with the intention of creating a multi-method approach to texturing landscapes within UE4. 

# Description
DLM was created for the sole purpose of providing users with a multi method texturing tool for landscapes in UE4. This means users can decide between hand-painting, auto slope/height, splatmap or weighted texture methods within one master material.

This material was creating using methods provided by a lot of people from various places around the internet including Epic Games, Unreal Forums and random Tutorial blogs.
Every technique used here can be found online somewhere with a bit of dedicated googling. This is why it is free!
